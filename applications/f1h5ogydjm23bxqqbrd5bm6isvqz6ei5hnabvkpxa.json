    "Brief history of your project and organization": "Established in 1981, STSCI has helped guide the most famous observatory in history, the Hubble Space Telescope. Since its launch in 1990, we have performed the science operations for Hubble. We also lead the science and mission operations for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which launched on December 25, 2021. We will perform parts of the science operations for the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, in formulation for launch in late 2026, and we are partners on several other NASA missions. Our staff conducts world-class scientific research; our Barbara A. Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) curates and disseminates data from over 20 astronomical missions; and we bring science to the world through internationally recognized news, education, and public outreach programs. We value our diverse workforce and civility in the workplace, and seek to be an example for others to follow.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is a multi-year survey that will discover exoplanets in orbit around bright stars across the entire sky using high-precision photometry. The survey will also enable a wide variety of stellar astrophysics, solar system science, and extragalactic variability studies.",
